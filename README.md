# Train_Itineraries
Computer Networks 2023 Final Project - Highest Difficulty Level

Implementation of a server that provides or updates real-time information from all registered customers for: train running, departure status, arrival status, delays and estimated arrival. The server reads the data from xml files and updates the data (delays and estimated arrivals) at the request of the clients (signal - receive). All the logic is done in the server, the client just asks for information about departures/arrivals and sends information to the server about possible delays and estimated arrivals.
